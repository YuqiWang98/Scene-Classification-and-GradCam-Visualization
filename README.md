# Scene-Classification-and-GradCam-Visualization
In this project, a deep learning model will be train based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to detect the type of scenery in images. This project could be practically used for detecting the type of scenery from the satellite images. In addition, this project will cover the use of a technique known as Grad-Cam to observe and explain how AI models think.
